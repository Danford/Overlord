 *   Note, results include "friend" which is 0 or 1 depending on if the friend being shown is 
 *   friends with, y'know, the person viewing the page.
 *   
 *   Note that the results currently sort by screen name. Later we can do like FB and show mutual friends first.
 *   
 *   Also will want the ability to unfriend or block friends if $profile->id == $user->id
